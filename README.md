This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this IP Address Tracker app. To get the IP Address locations, the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) was used. To generate the map, I used [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs).

The user should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## Links

- Deployment: [Findipy](https://findipy.vercel.app/)

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
